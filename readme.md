The behaviors that are scored in the Noldus Observer XT software should be for set periods of time (e.g., 5 min).
In some cases, Noldus event logs have behaviors that are scored beyond the specified times.
This program changes the time indices for any events beyond the allotted time so that they are no longer counted.
